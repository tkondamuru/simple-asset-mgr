## üñ• React SPA Interface

### Features:

- Enter metadata and create new puzzle via `/add-puzzle`.
- View all puzzles using `/puzzles`.
- Search puzzles using `/search`.
- Register test player and simulate puzzle completion.

### Components:
- Puzzle list view with GET buttons to test `/puzzles` and `/search`.
- Admin form with inputs for name, description, tags, SVG URL, pieces, and `POST` to `/add-puzzle`.
- Image upload tool for `/upload-image`.

### Deployment:
Include the SPA in the same repo or as part of a Cloudflare Pages project with static assets and React build in `dist/` or `public/`.

---

## üóÇ GitHub + Deployment

- Use a single GitHub repo.
- Define bindings in `wrangler.toml`.
- Auto-deploy via Cloudflare Pages or Workers.

#### Example Binding in `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "PLAYER_KV"
id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

---

## üîë Get Namespace IDs
use the Cloudflare dashboard.

---

## üß† Suggestions

- Use KV for simple lookups (users).
- Use D1 for structured data (scores, puzzles).
- Use R2 for assets (SVGs).
- Use SPA for user-friendly admin interface and testing.
